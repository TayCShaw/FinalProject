# FinalProject
Built by Taylor Shaw and Samuel Riegler
This project was our final project for CPS420: Web Applications Design. This project is supposed to be a super small, scaled-down, basic feature version of a forum site. Users can register, post new threads, and reply to existing threads. 
Built in Visual Studio with ASP.NET and C#. It is not a very extensive project, but it was a fairly extensive learning experience.
