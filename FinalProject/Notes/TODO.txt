ALREADY DONE:

	TO VIEW A THREAD
	1. Click on the thread's name (threadSubject) on Home/any page. The thread's name
		needs to be a hyperlink that redirects to "Viewing.aspx". It will be ./Viewing/(threadID).
		That hyperlink will also have to pass (threadID) to the page. "Viewing.aspx" will have
		to take in the (threadID) to search the database.
	2. Find ALL records that contain the (threadID) and pull them. You need to INNER JOIN the Posts,
		Users, and Threads table on [Users](userID) so you can grab the (userName).
		Sort by (timeCreated) for the posts. Then, from the same record, grab postContent, timeCreated,
		and userName.
	3. Put the above into a while loop to continually create <div>'s while there are posts available.
